      <a href="/contact" style="color: #e03800"> CONTACT US</a> to see our
      beautiful venue. We would love to schedule a private consultation with

    <p class="fw-bold fs-5">
      Both the Ballroom and Outdoor Patio Space Plans work best if printed on
      legal size paper. They are close to true scale, so you can print as large
      or small as you desire to get a better sense of how to plan your perfect
      event.

      Tables and chairs are provided and will be set up to according to your
      specifications (provided they meet manager approval and fire code
      requirements).
